# Odin Landing Page
Yet another tutorial from the tutorial hell.

Another attempt to get the HTML and CSS basics, hope this time info will stick.

For this project I'll be creating an entire webpage from a design that will be provided. 

The design provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, 
and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors that were used on previous lessons.

The goal is to get this project as close as I can to the design, however is not required getting it pixel-perfect.
The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less 
the right position relative to the rest.

Also it's encouraged to substitute my own content into this design. The images have some meaningless dummy content, 
however if needed - actual images can be paced in the placeholders, as well as change the colors and fonts a bit too.

Objectives:

- [x] Build a bear-bone HTML landing page with a Header and Footer
- [x] Place 3 main sections inside the body + a hero section
- [x] Align all the pieces inside each section using CSS flex-box
- [ ] Make sure that color and text elements match the requirements
